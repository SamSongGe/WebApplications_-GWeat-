We walked in and got on the list and were told 45 minutes, but we had to wait over an hour because people with reservations still went ahead of us and it was particularly busy. They finally sat us outside and it was so dark we couldn't see the menu or out food without pulling out our cell phones. I had the steak and enchiladas and it was delicious. It also came with some salad and veggies but I didn't know what they were, it was too dark. :D The corn bread was hyped up so we tried it, but it was just pretty good. I was told it was better the last time they came. All in all, a find experience but I didn't much appreciate not being considered worthy a table because we walked in. Make a reservation and you should be fine.",
